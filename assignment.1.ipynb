    "2.Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "Ans-Python is a versatile programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including **structured**, **object-oriented** and **functional** programming¹³. It is also **dynamically typed** and **garbage-collected**¹. Python has a comprehensive standard library that provides many built-in data types, such as **numeric**, **sequence**, **boolean**, **set**, **dictionary** and **binary** types."

    "3.Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Ans- Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, so identifiers are case-sensitive¹². That means it considers uppercase and lowercase characters differently. For example, `myPet` and `mypet` are different identifiers."

    "5.Is python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "Ans- Python is both a compiled and an interpreted language¹². Python source code is first compiled into bytecode, which is a low-level platform-independent representation of the code³⁴. Then, the bytecode is interpreted by a Python Virtual Machine, which executes the code on the device running the Python program¹². This allows Python to be platform-independent."

    "Ans- A block of code in Python is a group of statements that are executed as a unit¹³. Blocks of code are created by applying proper indentation for the statements to separate them from other blocks of code²⁴. Some examples of blocks of code in Python are: a module, a function body, a class definition, an if-else statement, a for loop, etc."

    "Ease of use and readability: Python has a simple, concise, and straightforward syntax that resembles plain English. This makes Python programs easy to write, read, and debug. Python also has a built-in interpreter that allows you to run your code without compiling it, which saves time and effort12.\n",
    "Extensibility and compatibility: Python can be extended with other languages, such as C, C++, or Java, to access their libraries and functionalities. Python also supports multiple programming paradigms, such as object-oriented, procedural, functional, and imperative. Python is platform-independent, meaning it can run on any operating system, such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS12.\n",
    "Rich libraries and frameworks: Python has a large and comprehensive standard library that provides built-in modules for various tasks, such as data structures, file operations, web development, database connectivity, networking, cryptography, etc. Python also has a wide range of third-party libraries and frameworks that offer additional features and functionalities for specific domains, such as data science, machine learning, web development, game development, etc. Some of the popular Python libraries and frameworks are NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Django, Flask, PyGame, etc134.\n",
    "Vibrant community and support: Python has a huge and active community of developers and users who contribute to its development and improvement.

This will automatically add the Python installation directory to your system’s PATH environment variable, which allows you to run Python from any command prompt.\n",
    "Alternatively, you can manually add Python to PATH after installing it. To do that, you need to find the directory where Python is installed, such as C:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310. Then, you need to open the Environment Variables menu by right-clicking on This PC, selecting Properties, clicking on Advanced system settings, and choosing Environment Variables. In the User variables section, select PATH and click on Edit. Then, click on New and paste the Python directory path. Click on OK to save the changes.\n",
    "To verify that Python is added to PATH, open a new command prompt and type python --version. You should see the version of Python that you installed. You can also type python to enter the interactive mode, where you can execute Python commands directly.\n",
